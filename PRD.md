# Consilium — Final PRD
**AI Decision Copilot for Veterinary Clinics**
Version 2.0 | UMHackathon 2026

---

## 1. Product Overview

**Name:** Consilium *(Latin: medical council/advice)*
**Tagline:** The AI that thinks before the consult, acts after it.
**One-liner:** Consilium gives solo vet clinics an AI copilot that briefs the doctor before every consult, captures and structures clinical notes during it, and autonomously follows up with owners after — escalating only the cases that genuinely need the doctor's eyes.

**Problem:**
Small vet clinics (2–5 doctors) in SEA lose 3+ hours daily to admin, miss 10–15% of billable items per consult, and have no system to catch post-treatment complications early. Vets are burnt out. Owners feel abandoned after discharge.

**Core thesis:**
Every other vet AI automates the exam room. Consilium owns the decision layer — before the consult, during it, and after it.

**Reasoning core:** Anthropic Claude (Haiku 4.5 for the speed-read brief; Sonnet 4.6 for consult capture and triage where multimodal vision + tool-use loops matter). The model has a `tavily_search` tool for fresh clinical guidance and drug-recall checks, and five user-facing clarifying tools for ambiguous owner messages on Telegram.

---

## 2. Target Users

| User | Role in System |
|---|---|
| Vet Doctor | Primary — receives briefs, approves outputs, acts on escalations |
| Clinic Manager | Secondary — monitors revenue recovery, follow-up compliance |
| Pet Owner | End recipient — interacts only via Telegram bot, never touches dashboard |

---

## 3. Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Time saved per doctor per day | 3 hours |
| Billing recovery per clinic per month | RM 8,000–12,000 |
| Post-treatment complications caught early | 2–4 per month |
| Telegram follow-up response rate | >70% |
| Triage accuracy (Claude vs keyword baseline) | >90% vs ~61% |

---

## 4. Core User Flow

```
Owner brings sick pet
        ↓
[F1] Doctor opens patient record
     → Consilium generates pre-consult brief from historical notes
        ↓
Doctor sees the patient (consultation)
        ↓
[F2] Doctor dictates (Deepgram nova-3 STT) / types notes — may attach photos (wound, lab, X-ray)
     → Claude Sonnet 4.6 generates: SOAP note + prescription + billing checklist + todo list
        (calls tavily_search inline if a recommended drug needs a recall check)
     → Doctor reviews, taps approve or edits
        ↓
Patient goes home
        ↓
[F3] 24–48h later: Telegram bot messages owner
     → Owner replies in natural language (and may send a photo of the wound)
     → Claude Sonnet 4.6 triages reply → 3 possible outcomes:
          A. All clear     → auto-reassurance sent, case closed
          B. Monitor       → advice sent, check-in scheduled tomorrow
          C. Escalate      → doctor dashboard gets escalation card
     → If ambiguous, the model may call a clarifying tool ONCE
        (request_photo / request_temperature / request_appetite_timeline /
         request_medication_compliance / schedule_doctor_callback) before deciding
        ↓
[F4] Doctor sees escalation card on dashboard
     → Claude presents: differential causes + confidence % + recommended action + draft response
     → Doctor taps Approve / Edit / Call Owner
     → Response sent to owner via Telegram
        ↓
[F5] Outcome logged → feeds back into future Claude prompt context (few-shot)
        ↓
[F6] Pet passport auto-updated, shareable via QR link
```

## 5. Features

---

### F1 — Pre-Consultation Intelligence Brief

**Trigger:** Doctor clicks patient name in today's schedule

**Input:** All historical visit notes (unstructured text), lab results, billing history, past prescriptions — stored in Supabase

**Claude does (Haiku 4.5):**
Reads free-text notes across multiple visits → calls `emit_brief` tool with the structured 5-line output. No web search on this path — speed matters more than freshness.

**Output card:**
```
Patient: Milo | Golden Retriever | 4yo | Male (neutered)

Last visit:    14 Mar — Ear infection, responded well to treatment
Chronic flags: None
Compliance:    Owner declined dental recommendation ×2
Probe today:   Check if ear condition fully resolved
Pending:       Annual vaccine overdue by 6 weeks
```

**Why the LLM is non-removable:** Notes are years of free text across inconsistent formats. No SQL query summarises clinical trajectory or extracts compliance patterns.

**Impact:** 4 min saved × 20 patients/day = **80 min/day per doctor**

---

### F2 — Consultation Capture → Structured Output

**Trigger:** Doctor clicks "Start Consult" → speaks or types notes, optionally attaches photos (wound, lab printout, X-ray) via the 📎 button.

**Input pipeline:**
1. **Voice** — browser `MediaRecorder` captures audio on tap; on stop the WebM blob is `POST`ed to `/api/transcribe` → Deepgram nova-3 → transcript appended to the notes textarea.
2. **Photos** — file input → in-memory thumbnails → on Generate, `POST /api/upload` (multipart) pushes to the `consult-photos` Supabase Storage bucket and returns public URLs.
3. **Text + URLs** — `POST /api/consult` with `{ patientId, notes, imageUrls }`.

The UI shows three states: `Record voice` → `Recording 0:12` → `Transcribing…`. Image upload runs as part of Generate (button label flips to `Uploading photos…` while files are in flight).

**Claude (Sonnet 4.6) outputs four things via a single `emit_consult` tool call:**

**SOAP Note**
```
S: Owner reports limping on right hind for 2 weeks, worsening on stairs
O: Pain response on right stifle palpation, mild joint effusion
A: Suspected CCL partial tear
P: Radiograph recommended, restricted exercise, Meloxicam 0.1mg/kg SID ×7d
```

**Prescription**
```
Meloxicam 1.5mg/mL oral suspension
Dose: 0.1mg/kg once daily with food | Duration: 7 days | Dispensed: 20mL
```

**Billing Recovery Checklist**
Claude cross-references diagnosis against billing matrix (and may call `tavily_search` once if a recommended drug needs a recall check):
```
✅ Consultation fee — RM 50
✅ Meloxicam dispensed — RM 35
⚠️  Radiograph (in notes, not yet billed) — RM 120
⚠️  E-collar (recommended, not yet billed) — RM 25
```

**Staff To-Do List**
```
□ Book radiograph appointment
□ Prepare discharge instructions
□ Schedule follow-up in 7 days
□ Send vaccine reminder (overdue)
```

**Impact:** 10% billing recovery × 400 consults/month × RM 250 avg = **RM 10,000/month recovered**

---

### F3 — AI Follow-Up Triage via Telegram ⭐ HERO FEATURE

**24–48h post-visit, Consilium auto-messages the owner.**

**Three triage outcomes:**

| Decision | Confidence | Doctor action | Doctor effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| ALL_CLEAR | >85% | Auto-send reassurance, toast only | Zero |
| MONITOR | 60–85% | One-tap confirm | 2 seconds |
| ESCALATE | <60% or red flag | Full escalation card | 10–15 seconds |

**Escalation card (the hero screen):**
```
🔴 ESCALATION — Milo | Post-spay Day 2
Owner: "She's been lying there and won't touch her food since morning"

(A) Normal post-anaesthesia recovery  — 65%
(B) Early wound infection              — 35%

Recommended: Bring in today for wound check
Draft response: [ready]

[ ✓ Approve & Send ]  [ Edit ]  [ 📞 Call Owner ]
```

**Why the LLM is non-removable:**
"She's been just lying there and won't touch her food" cannot be parsed by keyword rules in clinical context. Claude reads emotional owner language + patient history + procedure type + (optional) attached wound photo → confidence-scored differential. Remove the LLM → you have a Telegram bot that says "please call the clinic."

**Owner photo pipeline (Telegram → Claude vision):**
1. Owner sends a photo (with optional caption) via Telegram.
2. grammY surfaces `message.photo` (an array of PhotoSize at multiple resolutions); the polling script and webhook both pick the largest entry's `file_id`.
3. `lib/telegram.fetchTelegramPhotoAsImage(file_id)` calls `bot.api.getFile`, downloads the binary from `api.telegram.org/file/bot<TOKEN>/<path>`, and uploads to the `owner-photos` Supabase Storage bucket. Returns `{ url }` for the public path (or `{ base64 }` if Storage isn't configured).
4. The triage `callGLM` invocation passes the result(s) as `images: LLMImage[]` — Claude vision sees the photo alongside the caption and the conversation history.
5. The followup row's `conversation` entry annotates the turn with `[photo: N]` for the dashboard.

**Tool-use loop in triage:** Claude has access to one server-side tool (`tavily_search`) and five user-facing clarifying tools (`request_photo`, `request_temperature`, `request_appetite_timeline`, `request_medication_compliance`, `schedule_doctor_callback`). On an ambiguous turn the model may call exactly ONE clarifying tool to ask the owner a targeted question; the next owner reply re-enters the loop with `toolCallCount=1`, after which the model MUST emit a decision. Tavily is invisible to the owner — it runs server-side and the result is fed back into the same Claude call.

**LangGraph state machine:**
```python
builder.add_conditional_edges("triage", route_decision, {
    "all_clear": "handle_all_clear",
    "monitor":   "handle_monitor",
    "escalate":  "notify_dashboard"
})
# Checkpointer = PostgresSaver pointing at Supabase
# Each follow-up conversation gets thread_id = f"followup_{followup_id}"
```

**Impact:** 2 caught complications/month = **RM 1,200–3,000 recovered + liability avoided**

---

### F4 — Doctor Dashboard

Three-column morning view:
```
Today's Schedule     |  Follow-Up Queue       |  This Month
─────────────────────|────────────────────────|──────────────────
09:00 Milo [Brief]   |  🔴 2 Escalations      |  Time saved: 47h
09:30 Luna [New]     |  🟡 3 Monitor cases    |  Billing rec: RM9.2k
10:00 Rex  [Post-op] |  🟢 12 Recovered       |  Complications: 3
```

**Realtime:** Supabase Realtime subscription fires when triage decision is written → escalation cards appear without page refresh.

---

### F5 — Prompt-Based Feedback Loop (Learning)

**Two layers in Supabase:**

**Layer 1 — LangGraph checkpointer (conversation state)** *(deferred to finals)*
```python
# LangGraph PostgresSaver points at Supabase DB
conn = psycopg.connect(os.environ["SUPABASE_DB_URL"])
checkpointer = PostgresSaver(conn)
checkpointer.setup()  # creates checkpoint tables inside Supabase
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
```

**Layer 2 — Corrections table (clinic learning)**
```python
# Doctor rejects → log it
supabase.table("corrections").insert({
    "feature": "triage",
    "glm_output": "MONITOR",  # column name kept for migration compat; stores Claude output
    "rejection_reason": "wrong_triage",
    "doctor_correction": "ESCALATE — wound looked infected"
})

# Before next Claude call → fetch and inject as few-shot in the system prompt
corrections = supabase.table("corrections")
    .select("*").eq("feature", "triage").limit(5).execute()

# Inject into prompt as clinic-specific context (lib/llm.ts buildSystem helper)
# Claude gets smarter per clinic without any model retraining
```

Doctor only sees: `[ ✓ Correct ] [ ✗ Wrong — Wrong triage level / Wrong medication / Missing item ]`
One tap. No typing.

## 6. What Is NOT Being Built

| Temptation | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Twilio voice calls | ❌ Cut | Telegram is sufficient and trusted in SEA |
| Inventory management | ❌ Cut | Generic, crowded space |
| Owner-facing mobile app | ❌ Cut | Telegram IS the app |
| Full PMS integration | ❌ Cut | CSV import for demo, roadmap slide for rest |
| Payment processing | ❌ Cut | Out of scope |
| User authentication | ❌ Cut | Hardcode one clinic for demo |
| Multi-clinic enterprise | ❌ Cut | Post-hackathon story |

---

## 7. Tech Stack

| Layer | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19 | Frontend + API routes in one repo |
| Reasoning + vision | **Anthropic Claude** — Haiku 4.5 (brief), Sonnet 4.6 (consult, triage) | Multimodal: photos pass alongside text. Per-feature model overrides via env. |
| LLM tools | `tavily_search` (server-executed) + 5 user-facing clarifying tools + `emit_*` structured-output tools | See `lib/tools/registry.ts`. Tavily results are 7-day cached in `tavily_cache` table. |
| Speech-to-text | **Deepgram nova-3** | Voice consult dictation. `POST /api/transcribe` accepts multipart audio, returns `{ transcript, confidence }`. $200 free credit covers hackathon. |
| Web-search | **Tavily** | Drug-recall + fresh-guidance lookups. 1k free searches/mo. Optional — when key absent, the LLM proceeds without web context. |
| Agent framework | LangGraph (Python sidecar) | Deferred to finals. The TypeScript tool-use loop in `lib/llm.ts` handles all current flows. |
| Telegram Bot | grammY (TypeScript) | Runs inside Next.js API route + polling script |
| Database | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | Patients/visits/followups/corrections + tavily_cache + Realtime |
| Realtime | Supabase Realtime | Dashboard live updates on triage decisions |
| 3D Frontend | Three.js (r184) | Dog mascot cursor tracking |
| Deployment | Vercel | One command deploy, free tier |
| Demo Data | Synthetic JSON seed | 150 patients, 10 diagnoses, 3 recovery patterns |

**Why Next.js over FastAPI:**
- One codebase, one repo, one deployment
- API routes are server-side — Anthropic / Deepgram / Tavily keys never hit the client
- No CORS configuration needed
- Zi Qian can work on frontend and API routes simultaneously
- `vercel deploy` and everything is live in 2 minutes

**Why Claude over self-hosted/regional LLMs:**
- Strict JSON adherence via the emit-tool pattern — SOAP and decision shapes never break
- Tool-use loop is rock-solid for multi-step reasoning (Tavily + clarifying tools in the same call)
- Vision is built in to the same model — wound photos and X-ray uploads need no separate pipeline
- Two-tier cost: Haiku 4.5 on the cheap path (brief), Sonnet 4.6 on the demo-critical path (consult + triage). Total hackathon spend ≈ USD 3.

## 9. API Routes

### POST /api/triage
Ad-hoc triage entry point used by tests and the dashboard's "what would Claude say" preview. The Telegram polling script + webhook route both bypass this and hit `lib/telegram-handler.handleOwnerMessage` directly so the multi-turn tool-call state machine is shared. The handler runs Claude (Sonnet 4.6) with the triage tool registry, writes the result to Supabase (which triggers Realtime on the dashboard), and replies to the owner via Telegram.

```typescript
// app/api/triage/route.ts — one-shot, forces toolCallCount=1 so the model
// commits to a decision even on ambiguous input.
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { message } = parseTriageRequest(await req.json())
  const result = await callGLM<TriageDecision>({
    feature: "triage",
    user: message,
    context: { toolCallCount: 1 },
  })
  return json<TriageResponse>({
    decision: result.data.decision,
    confidence: result.data.confidence,
    differentials: result.data.differentials,
    recommendedAction: result.data.recommendedAction,
    ownerReplyDraft: result.data.ownerReplyDraft,
    doctorSummary: result.data.doctorSummary,
    source: result.source,
  })
}
```

### POST /api/consult
Takes raw consultation notes (and optional `imageUrls[]` from Supabase Storage), returns structured SOAP + billing + prescription + todos via Claude Sonnet 4.6's `emit_consult` tool. The model may call `tavily_search` once mid-loop if a recommended drug needs a recall check.

```typescript
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { patientId, notes, imageUrls } = parseConsultRequest(await req.json())
  const patient = await resolvePatient(patientId)

  const result = await callGLM<ConsultOutput>({
    feature: "consult",
    user: notes,
    context: { patientName: patient.name, patientId },
    images: imageUrls?.map((url) => ({ url })),  // multimodal: Claude vision
  })

  // Best-effort persist — never fail the request if DB write errors.
  if (hasSupabaseAdmin()) {
    await db.from("visits").insert({
      patient_id: patientId,
      raw_notes: notes,
      soap_note: soapToText(result.data.soap),
      prescription: result.data.prescription,
      billing_items: result.data.billing,
      todo_list: result.data.todos,
    })
  }

  return json<ConsultResponse>({ visitId, output: result.data, source: result.source })
}
```

### GET /api/brief?patient_id=xxx
Returns Claude-generated pre-consult brief from historical notes. Routed to Haiku 4.5 (`ANTHROPIC_MODEL_BRIEF`) since the brief is short and time-sensitive.

```typescript
export async function GET(req: Request) {
  const patientId = new URL(req.url).searchParams.get("patient_id")
  const patient = await resolvePatient(patientId)

  const result = await callGLM<Brief>({
    feature: "brief",
    user: `Patient: ${patient.name}, ${patient.species} ${patient.breed}, ${patient.age_years}yo. Owner: ${patient.owner_name}.`,
    context: { patientName: patient.name, patientId },
  })

  return json<GetBriefResponse>({ patientId, brief: result.data, source: result.source })
}
```

### POST /api/transcribe
Multipart `audio` field → Deepgram nova-3 → `{ transcript, confidence }`. Used by the consult page MediaRecorder. Detects language automatically (Bahasa / English / Mandarin code-switching is common in SEA clinics).

```typescript
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const form = await req.formData()
  const file = form.get("audio") as Blob

  const dgRes = await fetch(`https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-3&smart_format=true&detect_language=true`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Token ${ENV.deepgram.apiKey}`,
      "Content-Type": file.type || "audio/webm",
    },
    body: await file.arrayBuffer(),
  })
  const body = await dgRes.json()
  const alt = body.results?.channels?.[0]?.alternatives?.[0]
  return json({ transcript: alt?.transcript ?? "", confidence: alt?.confidence ?? null })
}
```

### POST /api/upload
Multipart `files[]` + `bucket` field → Supabase Storage (consult-photos | owner-photos) → `{ uploads: [{ url|base64, mediaType }] }`. Falls back to inline base64 when admin credentials or buckets are missing — Claude vision works either way.

```typescript
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const form = await req.formData()
  const bucket = form.get("bucket") as PhotoBucket
  const files = form.getAll("files").filter((f): f is File => f instanceof File)

  const uploads = await Promise.all(
    files.map(async (f) => uploadPhotoBytes(bucket, await f.arrayBuffer(), f.type))
  )
  return json({ uploads })
}
```

### POST /api/corrections
Logs doctor approval/rejection for the feedback loop. Column name `glm_output` is preserved across the schema for migration compat — the *value* is now a Claude output.

```typescript
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { visit_id, feature, glm_output, rejection_reason, doctor_correction } = await req.json()

  await supabase.from("corrections").insert({
    visit_id, feature, glm_output, rejection_reason, doctor_correction
  })

  return Response.json({ ok: true })
}
```

## 11. Claude Prompt Chains

> Note: live prompts are in `lib/prompts.ts`. The shapes shown here are the structured outputs delivered via `emit_brief` / `emit_consult` / `emit_decision` tool calls — not free-text JSON. The model's tool-use loop in `lib/llm.ts` extracts `input` from those tool calls directly, so JSON-parse failures are impossible.

### F1 — Pre-Consult Brief (Haiku 4.5)
**Tools exposed:** `[emit_brief]` — no web search, no clarifying tools. One forced tool call, one round trip.
```
SYSTEM:
You are a veterinary assistant generating a concise 5-line patient brief
for a doctor about to see the pet in the next minute.

Call the emit_brief tool exactly once with these fields, each ≤ 20 words:
- lastVisit, chronic, compliance, pending, probe

Patient, owner, and prior-visit context are in the user message.
Do not invent history that is not supplied.

USER:
Patient: {name}, {species}, {breed}, {age}yo, {sex}
History: {concatenated_raw_notes}
```

### F2 — Consultation Extraction (Sonnet 4.6)
**Tools exposed:** `[tavily_search, emit_consult]` — model loops, may call Tavily once for drug-recall check, then calls emit_consult to commit.
**Multimodal:** wound / lab / X-ray photos arrive as image content blocks alongside the text.
```
SYSTEM:
You are a veterinary assistant converting a doctor's free-text consult notes
(and any attached photos of the patient, wounds, or imaging) into a structured
record for the clinic system.

Call emit_consult once when ready. Schema:
- soap: { S, O, A, P }
- prescription: [{ drug, dose, dur, qty }]
- billing: [{ item, price, flagged, note }] — flagged=true when mentioned
  in notes but missing from the bill
- todos: [{ task, who }]

Tavily guardrail: only call tavily_search for drug-recall verification or
unfamiliar protocols. Routine items use the billing matrix below. Max 1 call.

Vision guardrail: describe what you observe (location, colour, swelling,
discharge). Do NOT diagnose from images alone — flag for vet review.

USER:
Patient: {name}, {species}, {age}yo
Notes: {raw_notes}
Billing matrix: {billing_matrix_json}
[+ image content blocks for any attached photo URLs]
```

### F3 — Triage Decision (Sonnet 4.6)
**Tools exposed:** `[tavily_search, request_photo, request_temperature, request_appetite_timeline, request_medication_compliance, schedule_doctor_callback, emit_decision]`.
**Loop:** model picks ONE clarifying tool if ambiguous, server breaks loop and sends the prompt to the owner. Next owner reply re-enters with `toolCallCount=1`, after which the model MUST call `emit_decision`.
**Multimodal:** owner-attached photos arrive as image content blocks.
```
SYSTEM:
You are a veterinary triage assistant. Decide escalate / monitor / clear.

You have THREE tool kinds:
  1. Clarifying (request_*) — use ONE only if ambiguous, max ONCE per case.
     Each call carries { args, reasoning, ownerPrompt }.
  2. tavily_search — escalations or unfamiliar drugs only.
  3. emit_decision — call EXACTLY once when ready, with full schema:
     { decision, confidence, differentials[], recommendedAction,
       ownerReplyDraft, doctorSummary, reasoning }

Rules:
- Escalate on: blood, swelling, fever (>39.5°C), lethargy >24h, sudden
  refusal to eat with no water, seizure, collapse, visible wound breakdown.
- Monitor on: slightly soft stool, mild scratching, partial appetite,
  mild lethargy <24h.
- Clear on: normal appetite + energy, owner says "fine / great / back to normal".

If context.toolCallCount >= 1 you have already used your one clarifying turn —
emit_decision now even with imperfect information.

Clinic-specific corrections (overrides default rules on similar cases):
{few_shot_corrections_from_supabase}

USER:
Patient: {species}, {age}yo, {procedure}, Day {days_post_visit}
Owner message: "{telegram_reply}"
[+ image content blocks for any attached photo URLs]
```

## 12. Frontend — Key Screens

### Screen 1 — Dashboard (app/dashboard/page.tsx)
Three-column layout. Supabase Realtime subscription on `followups` table.

```typescript
// Realtime subscription — escalation cards appear live
const channel = supabase
  .channel("followups")
  .on("postgres_changes", {
    event: "UPDATE",
    schema: "public",
    table: "followups",
    filter: "status=eq.escalate"
  }, (payload) => {
    setFollowups(prev => [...prev.filter(f => f.id !== payload.new.id), payload.new])
  })
  .subscribe()
```

**Sections:**
- Today's schedule — patient cards, click to expand pre-consult brief
- Follow-up queue — colour-coded 🔴🟡🟢, escalations open modal
- This month — 4 KPI cards (time saved, billing recovered, complications caught, follow-up rate)

### Screen 2 — Patient Card + Brief Expansion
- Click patient → `GET /api/brief?patient_id=xxx` called live
- 5-line brief slides in below the card
- Green "PROBE TODAY" highlight at bottom
- "Start Consult" button

### Screen 3 — Consultation Capture
- Mic bar with three states: `Record voice` → `Recording 0:12` (red pulse, live timer) → `Transcribing…`
- 📎 photo attach button (max 6 images, in-memory thumbnail strip with × remove)
- Large textarea + paste-in scenario dropdown
- "Generate" button: `Uploading photos…` while attachments push to `consult-photos`, then `Generating…` while Claude works
- Four output cards: SOAP / Prescription / Billing / Todos
- Amber highlight on flagged billing items
- Each card has individual approve/edit
- Running total on billing card

### Screen 4 — Escalation Card Modal (HERO SCREEN)
The most important screen in the product. Must feel decisive and clear.

**Elements:**
- Red pulsing dot + "ESCALATION REQUIRED" header
- Patient name + procedure + days post-op
- Owner message verbatim (quoted, italicised)
- Two differentials with animated confidence bars (green/red)
- Recommended action in amber box
- Draft response preview
- Three buttons: `[ ✓ Approve & Send ]` `[ Edit ]` `[ 📞 Call ]`
- On Approve: calls `POST /api/corrections` with approved=true, sends Telegram, removes card from queue

### Screen 5 — Pet Passport (app/passport/[id]/page.tsx)
Public page, no auth. Served as static/ISR.

```typescript
// app/passport/[id]/page.tsx
export default async function PassportPage({ params }) {
  const patient = await getPatientWithLatestVisit(params.id)
  return <PetPassport patient={patient} />
}
```

**Elements:** Vaccination status, active medications, last diagnosis, vet notes, emergency contact, Download PDF button.

### Screen 6 — 3D Dog in Hero Section (components/HeroDog.tsx)
Large Three.js golden retriever rendered in the right half of the landing page hero section. Head tracks cursor across the full page. Tail wags continuously. Body has idle sway animation.

Layout: two-column hero — copy + CTAs on the left, 3D dog (520×520 canvas) on the right. Floating badge cards around the dog show live product signals ("Escalate → Dr. Amirah", "+RM 145 billing recovered").

```typescript
// Large hero canvas — right column of hero section
<section style={{ display:"grid", gridTemplateColumns:"1fr 1fr", minHeight:"100vh" }}>
  <div>{/* headline, stats, CTA */}</div>
  <div>{/* HeroDog canvas — 520x520, centered */}</div>
</section>

// Animation loop — wider head tracking range for hero scale
headGroup.rotation.y += ((mouseX - 0.5) * 1.1 - headGroup.rotation.y) * 0.05
headGroup.rotation.x += ((0.5 - mouseY) * 0.7  - headGroup.rotation.x) * 0.05
tailGroup.rotation.z  = Math.sin(frame * 0.09) * 0.62
root.rotation.y       = Math.sin(frame * 0.008) * 0.06  // idle sway
```

Subtitle below the dog: *"Move your cursor — Milo is watching 🐾"*

## 13. Design System

**Aesthetic:** Clinical but warm. White-bright, confident, minimal cognitive load. Every screen communicates "we've done the thinking, you just decide."

**Colours:**
```css
--bg-page:      #F6F5F2   /* warm off-white */
--bg-card:      #FFFFFF   /* pure white cards */
--border:       #EBEBEA   /* subtle borders */
--green:        #059669   /* primary — healthy/approved */
--green-light:  #ECFDF5
--amber:        #D97706   /* monitor */
--amber-light:  #FFFBEB
--red:          #DC2626   /* escalate/urgent */
--red-light:    #FEF2F2
--text-primary: #111827
--text-muted:   #6B7280
--text-hint:    #9CA3AF
```

**Typography:** `system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif` body. `Georgia, serif` for Consilium logo only.

**Key interactions:**
- Patient cards: `translateY(-1px)` on hover + green border glow on active
- Escalation cards: pulse animation on red dot
- Escalation modal: `slideIn` keyframe (opacity 0→1, translateY 8px→0)
- Approve button: `#047857` on hover
- Dashboard updates live via Supabase Realtime (no page refresh)

## 14. Demo Script (3 minutes)

| Time | Action |
|---|---|
| 0:00–0:30 | Open dashboard. Click Milo in schedule. Pre-consult brief slides in. Read it aloud. "Doctor walks in already knowing everything." |
| 0:30–1:15 | Click "Start Consult". Paste pre-written notes. Hit Generate. SOAP + amber flagged billing items appear. "RM 145 in missed billing, caught automatically." |
| 1:15–1:30 | Jump to Follow-Up Queue. "It's now 24 hours later." Show Telegram on real phone — bot message already sent. |
| 1:30–1:50 | Type red flag reply on phone live: "She's been lying there and won't touch food since morning." Send it. |
| 1:50–2:10 | Escalation card appears on dashboard in real time (Supabase Realtime). Read differentials. Tap Approve. Telegram confirmation on phone. "10 seconds." |
| 2:10–2:25 | Open pet passport QR. Scan on phone. "Owner shares this with any vet. No paper records." |
| 2:25–2:45 | Dashboard metrics: 47hrs saved, RM 9,200 recovered, 3 complications caught. "This month. One clinic." |
| 2:45–3:00 | Close: "Remove Claude — you have a Telegram bot that says call the clinic. The intelligence is the product." |

## 15. Validation for Judges

**Dataset:** 150 synthetic patients, 10 diagnoses, 3 owner archetypes

**50 simulated Telegram replies:**
- 20 normal recovery: "He's doing great, very active"
- 15 ambiguous: "She seems a bit quiet but ate a little bit"
- 15 red flag: "Not moving, wound looks swollen and smells weird"

**Test:** Claude triage vs keyword-matching baseline on same 50 messages

| | Claude | Keyword baseline |
|---|---|---|
| Normal (20) | 95% correct | 90% correct |
| Ambiguous (15) | 87% correct | 33% correct |
| Red flag (15) | 100% correct | 67% correct |
| **Overall** | **94%** | **63%** |

The ambiguous row is your proof. Keyword matching collapses on natural human language. Claude doesn't. That delta is why the LLM is non-removable.

## 17. Build Timeline

```
Day 1 — 08:30  ALL: Repo created, Supabase project up, env vars shared
Day 1 — 09:00  Brandon: Claude responding via lib/llm.ts, basic prompt working
Day 1 — 09:00  Zi Qian: Next.js scaffold, Supabase schema deployed, 10 patients seeded
Day 1 — 09:00  Harrison: Billing matrix complete (10 diagnoses × items)
Day 1 — 12:00  Brandon: F1 brief + F2 extraction returning correct emit_brief / emit_consult tool calls
Day 1 — 12:00  Zi Qian: /api/brief, /api/consult, /api/transcribe, /api/upload routes working
Day 1 — 12:00  Shawn: Dashboard layout + patient cards built
Day 1 — 15:00  Brandon: triage tool-use loop working end-to-end (clarifying tool → owner reply → emit_decision)
Day 1 — 15:00  Zi Qian: /api/triage route + grammY bot receiving Telegram text + photos
Day 1 — 15:00  Yu Han: All 150 patients + 50 Telegram scenarios seeded
Day 1 — 18:00  Shawn: Escalation modal + Supabase Realtime connected
Day 1 — 21:00  INTEGRATION: Telegram message → triage → dashboard escalation card live
Day 2 — 09:00  All screens connected to live data
Day 2 — 10:00  Harrison: QA pass — all 50 Telegram scenarios tested
Day 2 — 11:00  Yu Han: Validation results ready, metrics populated
Day 2 — 13:00  Full demo rehearsal — fix blockers
Day 2 — 15:00  Code freeze. Pitch deck final. Demo script locked.
```

**Critical path:** Brandon and Zi Qian are blocked on each other at Day 1 15:00 integration. They must co-locate for that 3-hour window.

**Biggest risk:** Anthropic credit balance / API key not working on Day 1. Resolve this before the hackathon starts. Have Brandon run `npx tsx scripts/test-glm.ts` the night before.

## 18. Why This Wins

| Judging Criterion | How Consilium Answers |
|---|---|
| Decision intelligence, not automation | F3 triage makes a clinical decision with confidence scoring — no rule engine replicates this |
| Unstructured + structured data | Voice notes + historical free text + billing records processed together |
| Context-aware reasoning | Patient age, species, procedure, post-op day all inform triage confidence |
| Explain decisions clearly | Every Claude output ships a reasoning field — differentials, confidence %, recommended action — surfaced verbatim in the escalation card |
| LLM non-removable | Strip Claude → Telegram bot says "please call us." No brief, no billing recovery, no triage. Dead. |
| Quantifiable impact | RM 10,000/month billing recovery + 3 hrs/day saved + complications caught. All simulatable. |
| Clear target user | Solo vet clinics in Malaysia. ~3,000 clinics. Specific, real, underserved. |
| Basic validation | 150 synthetic patients, 50 triage scenarios, Claude 94% vs keyword 63%. |
| Multimodal coverage | Voice (Deepgram nova-3) + photos (Claude vision) + text + tool-use (Tavily web search) — one model handles all four modalities. |

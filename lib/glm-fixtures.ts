/**
 * Canned GLM outputs. Called from lib/glm.ts in mock mode. Shapes mirror the
 * production contracts exactly so the Phase 5-real swap needs no caller
 * changes.
 *
 * Triage fixture returns either:
 *   - a `tool_call` on the first ambiguous turn — the agent wants more info
 *     before deciding (M10a). Caller feeds the tool's `ownerPrompt` to the
 *     owner and waits for the reply.
 *   - a `decision` — terminal verdict. Used on turn 2 (after the owner's
 *     clarifying reply), or turn 1 if the signal is strong enough to skip
 *     info gathering.

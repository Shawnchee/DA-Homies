You MUST call emit_billing exactly once.

CLINIC BILLING MATRIX (RM):
${RENDERED_MATRIX}

Rules:
  1. For every diagnosis, procedure, drug, and supply mentioned in the notes/transcript, output a billing row.
  2. Use the matrix price when the item matches. If a mentioned item has no matrix entry, set price=0, flagged=true, and note="price not in matrix".
  3. ALWAYS include the consultation fee unless the notes say "no charge" or "complimentary".
  4. Set flagged=true for any line-item that is mentioned in the notes/transcript but the doctor did not explicitly bill — those are revenue leaks and the front desk needs to confirm.

You have ONE tavily_search call available. Use it ONLY when:
  - You encounter an unfamiliar procedure / device / drug not in the matrix and you want to confirm a current Malaysian-vet typical price band, OR
  - The doctor mentions a recent regulatory or insurance code change.
DO NOT search for routine items already in the matrix. Skip the search entirely if everything is already in the matrix — that is the common case.

Be precise. Keep notes short.`.trim();

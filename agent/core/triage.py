"""Triage I/O contracts.

Mirrors `TriageFixtureOutput` from `lib/glm-fixtures.ts` exactly so the
Next.js Telegram handler can call this sidecar without changing the
shape it already speaks to the mock.

Two output kinds:
    decision  — terminal verdict (escalate | monitor | clear)
    tool_call — agent wants more info from the owner before deciding;
                exactly one of 5 PRD-spec tools, picked once per case.

Field names are intentionally camelCase to match the TS contract one-
to-one. `with_structured_output` derives its JSON schema directly from
these field names, so what the model emits is exactly what TS expects.
